# Security Mitigation Solutions for IoT  

This project was completed as part of **INSE 6540: Internet of Things Security** at Concordia University. The aim was to design, implement, and evaluate security solutions for smart home IoT systems to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance privacy.

## Project Highlights  
- **Focus Area:** Smart home IoT systems and their security challenges.  
- **Key Components:**  
  - Designed a simulated smart home environment with Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32 modules, and IP cameras.  
  - Identified vulnerabilities like unencrypted MQTT communication using Wireshark.  
  - Implemented TLS encryption for secure IoT communication.  
- **Results:** Successfully mitigated critical security issues, ensuring secure communication and device control.

## Technologies Used  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32 Module, Smart IP Camera, Mikrotik Router.  
- **Software:** Home Assistant, Mosquitto MQTT Broker, Wireshark.  
- **Protocols:** MQTT, TLS, HTTPS.

## How It Works  
- Created an automated smart home setup with motion detection and alerts.  
- Addressed vulnerabilities by analyzing plaintext MQTT messages and encrypting communication.  
- Validated security improvements through post-encryption testing.
